                    my name is Rawan I graduated from tibah uni 
                    in business major I always loved technology 
                    while getting my degree i taught myself coding 
                    by bootcamp starting from html css and js and 
                    well that was the hardest I mean js haha.. 
                    but the satisfaction from building something 
                    from scratch and see it evolve was worth it all 
                    and I continued my journey learning more 
                    frameworks and still want learn more </p>
